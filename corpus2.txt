He followed her through the door.

They were now in the passenger  compartment  and  Zaphod's  heart
stopped still again for a moment.

In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.

The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were
long, the men wore beards.

All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping.

Zaphod had the creeping horrors.

He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was
half-way  down  the  aisle,  the stewardess had reached the other
end. She turned and spoke.

"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said  sweetly,  "Thank
you  for  bearing  with  us  during this slight delay. We will be
taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to  wake
up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits."

There was a slight hum.

At that moment, all the passengers awoke.

They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support
systems  that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.

They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently  moved  up
the  aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits
in front of each one of them.
Then one of them rose from his seat.

He turned and looked at Zaphod.

Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was  trying
to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam.

He plunged through the door and back into the corridor.

The man pursued him.

He raced in a frenzy to the end  of  the  corridor,  through  the
entrance  chamber  and  beyond.  He  arrived  on the flight deck,
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the
door breathing hard.

Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.

>From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.

"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return  to
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits
are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please  return
to your seat."

Zaphod said nothing. He  breathed  hard,  behind  him,  the  hand
continued to knock on the door.

"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers
are not allowed on the flight deck."

"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod.

"Please return to your seat."

"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again.

"Please return to your seat."

"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?"

"Please return to your seat."

You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod.

"Yes," said the voice from the flight console.

"You're in charge of this ship?"

"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay.  Passengers
are  to  be  kept  temporarily  in suspended animation, for their
comfort and convenience. Coffee and  biscuits  are  being  served
every  year,  after  which  passengers  are returned to suspended
animation for their continued comfort and convenience.  Departure
will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize
for the delay."

Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the  pounding  had  now
ceased. He approached the flight console.
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world  outside  this  ship?
It's  a  wasteland,  a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man.
There  are  no  lemon-soaked  paper  napkins  on  the  way   from
anywhere!"

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is
that  other  civilizations  will  arise.  There  will  one day be
lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till  then  there  will  be  a  short
delay. Please return to your seat."

"But ..."

But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see  the
man  who  had  pursued  him  standing  there.  He carried a large
briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had
no beard and no long fingernails.

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is  Zarniwoop.  I  believe
you wanted to see me."

Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said  foolish  things.  He
dropped into a chair.

"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said.

"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone.

He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.

"I am glad you followed instructions," he  said,  "I  was  a  bit
nervous  that  you  might  have left my office by the door rather
than the window. Then you would have been in trouble."

Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.

"When  you  entered  the  door  of  my  office,  you  entered  my
electronically  synthesized  Universe," he explained, "if you had
left by the door you would have been back in the  real  one.  The
artificial one works from here."

He patted the briefcase smugly.

Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.

"What's the difference?" he muttered.

"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except  that
I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe."

"What's going on?" spat Zaphod.

"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance  and  smugness  made
Zaphod seethe.

"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the  coordinated
at  which  this  man  could  be  found  -  the  man who rules the
Universe, and discovered that  his  world  was  protected  by  an
Unprobability  field.  To  protect  my  secret  -  and myself - I
retreated to the safety of this totally artificial  Universe  and
hid  myself  away  in  a  forgotten  cruise  liner. I was secure.
Meanwhile, you and I ..."

"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?"

"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well."

"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.

"Meanwhile,  you  and  I  arranged  that  you  would  steal   the
Improbability  Drive  ship  -  the only one which could reach the
ruler's world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I
trust,  and  I  congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile
which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.

"Oh, and in case you  were  wondering,"  added  Zarniwoop,  "this
Universe  was  created  specifically  for you to come to. You are
therefore the most important person in this Universe.  You  would
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived
the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?"

"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed.

"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?"

"No."

"Where is your jacket?"

Zaphod looked at him in mystification.

"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside."

"Good, we will go and find it."

Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him.

Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits.

"It has not been a pleasant experience  waiting  for  you,"  said
Zarniwoop.

"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think ..."

Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung  open.
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in
the debris.

"A very remarkable  and  very  powerful  ship,"  said  Zarniwoop,
"watch."

As they watched, the pocket on the  jacket  suddenly  bulged.  It
split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that
Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing.

It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its
full size.
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of ... oh  I  don't
know, but something very large."

Zaphod swayed.

"You mean I had it with me all the time?"

"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it.

He twisted a single switch inside it.

"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!"

The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared  exactly
as before.

"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same."

 "You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with  me  all
the time?"

"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point."

"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from  hereon  in
you  can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your
own games."

"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are  entwined
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape."

He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and  this  time
Zaphod hit it.




Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold.

"Trillian!  Arthur!"  he  shouted,  "it's  working!  The   ship's
reactivated!"

Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor.

"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he  said  kicking
them awake.

"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be
back  with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that
..."

"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are."

"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod  running  on
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me
you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."

"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from  the
floor and not taking any of this in.
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm  so  great  even  I  get
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian,
Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer ...?"

"Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to ..."

"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast."

"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?"

"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod,  "yes  it  does!"  he
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!"

"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a  massive  explosion
rocket the bridge.

When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye,  he
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest.




Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness.  Consciousness
had  died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the
pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally  around  them
and  they  sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red
that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever.

After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying
on  a  cold  hard  shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of
Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Cold spasms shook them, lights danced  sickeningly  around  them.
The  cold  hard  shore  tipped  and span and then stood still. It
shone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore.

A green blur watched them disapprovingly.

It coughed.

"Good evening,  madam,  gentlemen,"  it  said,  "do  you  have  a
reservation?"

Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back  like  elastic,  making
his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur.

"Reservation?" he said weakly. "Yes, sir," said the green blur.

"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?"

In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.

"Afterlife, sir?" it said.

Arthur Dent was grappling with  his  consciousness  the  way  one
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered.

"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to  work  out  which
way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite
direction from the cold hard shore on which  he  was  lying,  and
staggered to what he hoped were his feet.

"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could  have
survived that blast is there?"

"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again.

"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all."

A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It  was  Zaphod
Beeblebrox  attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it."

"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a  chance.  We
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere."

"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet.

"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks  ..."  said
the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them.

"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously  zonked  into
our  component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of
the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that  thing
of your whole life flashing before you?"

"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?"

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine.  I  spent  a
lot of time out of my skulls you know."

He looked at around him at the various shapes that were  at  last
becoming  proper  shapes  instead of vague and wobbling shapeless
shapes.

"So ..." he said.

"So what?" said Ford.

"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead ..."

"Standing," Trillian corrected him.

"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate ..."

"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and  could
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing
that surprised him was not that he could see, but what  he  could
see.

"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in  this
desolate ..."
"Five star ..." said Trillian.

"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod.

"Odd isn't it?" said Ford.

"Er, yeah."

"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian.

They looked about themselves in bemusement.

"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur,  "more  a  sort  of
apres vie."

The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and  the
low  vaulted  ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal
Universe, have been painted in  that  particular  shade  of  deep
turquoise,  and  even  if  it  had  been  it  wouldn't  have been
highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not,  however,  an
ideal  Universe,  as  was  further  evidenced by the eye-crossing
patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the  way  in  which  the
fronting  for  the  eighty-yard  long  marble-topped bar had been
made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had
been  made  by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean
Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that  the  twenty  thousand
lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.

A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar
or  relaxing  in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were
deployed here and there about  the  bar  area.  A  young  Vl'Hurg
officer  and  his  green  steaming  young lady passed through the
large smoked glass doors at the far  end  of  the  bar  into  the
dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond.

Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He  pulled  aside
the  corner  of  the  curtain and looked out at a landscape which
under normal circumstances would have given Arthur  the  creeping
horrors.  These  were not, however, normal circumstances, for the
thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up  his
back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ...

An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place.

"All in good time, sir," he said.

Zaphod's eyes flashed.

"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're  missing
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said
and we missed it."

Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he
had just seen.

He said, "I said it was a sort of apres ..."

"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?"
"I said it was odd."

"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ..."

"Perhaps," interrupted the  green  blur  who  had  by  this  time
resolved  into  the  shape  of  a small wizened dark-suited green
waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks
..."

"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you  miss  if  you
don't stay alert."

"Indeed sir,"  said  the  waiter  patiently.  "If  the  lady  and
gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner ..."

"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion,  "Listen,  little  green
person,  my  stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night
for the mere idea."

"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined  not  to
be  deflected  on  his home stretch, "will explode later for your
pleasure."

Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling.

"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?"

The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh.

"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me."

"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford.

The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough.

"It is not unusual for our customers to be a  little  disoriented
by the time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest ..."

"Time journey?" said Zaphod.

"Time journey?" said Ford.

"Time journey?" said Trillian.

"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur.

The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He  had  almost
exhausted  his  polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be
slipping into his role of a rather  tight  lipped  and  sarcastic
little waiter.

"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir."

"And we're not dead?" said Arthur.

The waiter tightened his lips.

"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most  evidently  alive,  otherwise  I
would not attempt to serve sir."
In an extraordinary gesture  which  is  pointless  attempting  to
describe,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two
of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.

"Hey guys," he said, "This  is  crazy.  We  finally  did  it.  We
finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!"

"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel,
"this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

"End of what?" said Arthur.

"The  Universe,"  repeated   the   waiter,   very   clearly   and
unnecessarily distinctly.

"When did that end?" said Arthur.

"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter.  He  took  a  deep
breath.  He  didn't  need  to do this since his body was supplied
with the peculiar assortment of gases it  required  for  survival
from  a  small  intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are
times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take  a
deep breath.

"Now, if you would care to order drinks at  last,"  he  said,  "I
will then show you to your table."

Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over  to  the  bar  and
bought most of it.




The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most
extraordinary  ventures in the entire history of catering. It has
been built on the fragmented remains of ... it will be  built  on
the fragmented ... that is to say it will have been built by this
time, and indeed has been -

One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not  that
of  accidentally  becoming your own father or mother. There is no
problem involved in becoming your own father  or  mother  that  a
broadminded  and  well-adjusted  family can't cope with. There is
also no problem about changing the course of history - the course
of  history  does  not change because it all fits together like a
jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things
they  were  supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the
end.

The major problem is quite simply one of grammar,  and  the  main
work  to  consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time
Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will  tell  you
for  instance  how to describe something that was about to happen
to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping  forward
two  days  in  order  to  avoid  it.  The event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking  about  it  from
the  standpoint  of  your  own  natural  time, from a time in the
further future, or a time in the  further  past  and  is  further
complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst
you are actually travelling from one time  to  another  with  the
intention of becoming your own father or mother.

Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up:
and in fact in later editions of the book all  the  pages  beyond
this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

The Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  skips  lightly  over  this
tangle  of  academic  abstraction,  pausing only to note that the
term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was  discovered
not to be.

To resume:

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering.

It is built on the fragmented remains  of  an  eventually  ruined
planet  which  is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble
and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of
the Universe.

This is, many would say, impossible.

In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen)
the whole of creation explode around them.

This is, many would say, equally impossible.

You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any  sitting  you  like
without  prior  (late fore-when) reservation because you can book
retrospectively, as it were when you return  to  your  own  time.
(you  can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta
retrohome.)

This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible.

At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with  (mayan  meetan  con
with  dinan  on  when)  a fascinating cross-section of the entire
population of space and time.

This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible.

You can visit it as many times as you like  (mayan  on-visit  re-
onvisiting  ... and so on - for further tense-corrections consult
Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself,
because of the embarrassment this usually causes.

This, even if the rest were true, which  it  isn't,  is  patently
impossible, say the doubters.

All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings  account  in
your  own  era,  and  when  you  arrive  at  the  End of Time the
operation of compound interest means that the  fabulous  cost  of
your meal has been paid for.
This, many claim, is not merely impossible  but  clearly  insane,
which  is  why  the  advertising executives of the star system of
Bastablon  came  up  with  this  slogan:  "If  you've  done   six
impossible  things  this  morning,  why  not  round  it  off with
breakfast  at  Milliways,  the  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the
Universe?"




At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a  newt.  His
heads  knocked  together and his smiles were coming out of synch.
He was miserably happy.

"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst  you're  still  capable  of  speech,
would  you  care  to tell me what the photon happened? Where have
you been? Where have we been?  Small  matter,  but  I'd  like  it
cleared up."

Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink  further
into the obscurity of drink.

"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the  man
who  rules  the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe
the man can't cook."

His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded.

"True," it said, "have another drink."

Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has
been  described  as  the  alcoholic  equivalent  of  a  mugging -
expensive and bad for  the  head.  Whatever  had  happened,  Ford
decided, he didn't really care too much.

"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."

"You mean everything's under control."

"No," said Zaphod, "I do not  mean  everything's  under  control.
That  would  not  be  cool  and  froody. If you want to know what
happened let's just say I had the whole situation in  my  pocket.
OK?"

Ford shrugged.

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.

A wild-skinned sky-gypsy  approached  them  and  played  electric
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed
to go away again.

The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another  part
of the bar.

"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I  think  it
gives me the creeps."
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself."

"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive."

"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?"

"You call this life?"

"You're beginning to sound like Marvin."

"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think  we  make
this violinist go away?"

The waiter approached.

"Your table is ready," he said.

Seen  from  the  outside,  which  it  never  is,  the  Restaurant
resembles  a  giant  glittering  starfish  beached on a forgotten
rock. Each of  its  arms  houses  the  bars,  the  kitchens,  the
forcefield  generators which protect the entire structure and the
decayed planet on which it sits,  and  the  Time  Turbines  which
slowly  rock  the  whole affair backwards and forwards across the
crucial moment.

In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome,  almost  a  complete
globe,  and  it  was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and
Trillian now passed.

At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them,
and  covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not
available  because  they  were  already  encrusted  with  jewels,
precious  sea  shells  from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles,
lizard skins and  a  million  unidentifiable  embellishments  and
decorations.  Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur
Dent goggled.

"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."

"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people ... ! The  things  ...
!"

"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people."

"The people ..." resumed Arthur, "the ... other people ..."

"The lights ... !" said Trillian.

"The tables ..." said Arthur.

"The clothes ... !" said Trillian.

The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs.

"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod  threading
his  way  unsteadily  through  the throng of tables, some made of
marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of  platinum,  and
at  each  a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves
and studying menus.
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives  it  a
sense of occasion."

The tables were fanned out in a large  circle  around  a  central
stage  area where a small band were playing light music, at least
a thousand tables was Arthur's guess,  and  interspersed  amongst
them  were  swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary,
in short all the paraphernalia common to  all  Restaurants  where
little  expense  has  been  spared to give the impression that no
expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to
see someone making an American Express commercial.

Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod.

"Wowee," said Zaphod.

"Zappo," said Ford.

"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up  the  computer's
works,  you  know,"  said  Zaphod,  "I  told it to take us to the
nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the  Universe.
Remind me to be nice to it one day."

He paused.

"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody."

"Was?" said Arthur.

"At the End of the Universe you have to  use  the  past  tense  a
lot,"  said  Zaphod,  "'cos  everything's been done you know. Hi,
guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms,
"How did you do?"

"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana.

"I think so," replied the second iguana.

"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana.

"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana.

"It's what you make of it," said the first and they  lapsed  back
into  silence.  They  were  waiting  for the greatest show in the
Universe.

"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of
the  third  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster, missing. He pointed a
swaying finger.

"There's an old mate of mine," he said,  "Hotblack  Desiato!  See
the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?"

Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes  but  it  made
him feel dizzy. Finally he saw.

"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later.  "Hey,"
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the
biggest thing ever. Other than me."

"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian.

"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know?
You never heard of Disaster Area?"

"No," said Trillian, who hadn't.

"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest ..."

"Richest ..." suggested Zaphod.

"... rock band in the history of ..." he searched for the word.

"... history itself," said Zaphod.

"No," said Trillian.

"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."

He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time
at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone.

Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance.

"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to  see
you  big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very,
very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and
was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan
Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him  told  him  to
plunge on regardless.

"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to  hang  out,  right?
The   Bistro  Illegal,  remember?  Slim's  Throat  Emporium?  The
Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?"

Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great
days or not. Ford was not perturbed.

"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public  health  inspectors,
you  remember  that?  And go around confiscating meals and drinks
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then  there  were  the
long  nights  of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above
the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always  in
the  next  room  trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all
hated them. And you said you didn't care,  and  we  said  we  did
because  we  hated  them  so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to
mist over.

"And you said you didn't  want  to  be  a  star,"  he  continued,
wallowing  in  nostalgia,  "because you despised the star system.
And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't  think  you
had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!"

He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables.

"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!"
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or  deny  this
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly.

"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into
his wine glass.

Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing
Hotblack Desiato.

"What's that number you do?" he  said,  unwisely  grabbing  at  a
bottle  for  support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as
it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass.

"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? `Bwarm!
Bwarm!  Baderr!!'  something, and in the stage act you do it ends
up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and  you  actually
do it!"

Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again.

"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he  cried.  "I  mean  forget  lasers  and
stuff,  you  guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and
terrible songs."

His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle
on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought.

"Hey, you want a drink?" he said.  It  began  to  sink  into  his
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and
that the missing something was in some  way  connected  with  the
fact  that  the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit
and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or  "Great  to
see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to
the point he had not yet even moved.

"Hotblack?" said Ford.

A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and  pushed
him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to
see if he could spot the owner of  this  discourteous  hand.  The
owner  was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of
the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with  it.  In
fact  he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy
and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into  which  the  man's
body  had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was
to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into
a  suit.  The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of
an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.

"Kid ..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth  as  if
it had been having a really rough time down in his chest.

"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to  his
feet  again  and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't
come further up the man's body.

"Beat it," said the man.
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being,  "and  who
are you?"

The man considered this for a moment. He  wasn't  used  to  being
asked  this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came
up with an answer.

"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before  you
get it beaten for you."

"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop
spinning,  settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and
..."

He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as
an eyelash.

"... and ..." said Ford again, wondering what  would  be  a  good
word to say after "and".

The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He
said it.

"And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away
before it gets damaged."

"Now wait a minute," said Ford.

"No minutes!" boomed  the  bodyguard,  "no  waiting!  Mr  Desiato
speaks to no one!"

"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about  the  matter
himself," said Ford.

"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard.

Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to  admit
to  himself  that  the  bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his
side. There was still not the slightest  sign  of  movement,  let
alone keen interest in Ford's welfare.

"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?"

The bodyguard told him.




The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy,  but  in
fact  the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers
judge that the best sound balance is usually  to  be  heard  from
within  large  concrete  bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the
stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments  by
remote  control  from  within a heavily insulated spaceship which
stays in orbit around the planet - or more  frequently  around  a
completely different planet.

Their songs are on the whole very simple and  mostly  follow  the
familiar  theme  of  boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery
moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether,  sometimes  for
artistic  reasons,  but  most  commonly because the band's public
address  system  contravenes  local  strategic  arms  limitations
treaties.

This has not, however, stopped their earnings from  pushing  back
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research
accountant   has   recently   been   appointed    Professor    of
Neomathematics  at  the University of Maximegalon, in recognition
of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax
Returns,  in  which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-
time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.

Ford staggered  back  to  the  table  where  Zaphod,  Arthur  and
Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin.

"Gotta have some food," said Ford.

"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?"

Ford waggled his head noncommittally.

"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah."

"What'd he say?"

"Well, not a lot really. He's ... er ..."

"Yeah?"

"He's spending a year dead for  tax  reasons.  I've  got  to  sit
down."

He sat down.

The waiter approached.

"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like  to
meet the Dish of the Day?"

"Huh?" said Ford.

"Huh?" said Arthur.

"Huh?" said Trillian.

"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."

In a small room in one of the arms of the  Restaurant  complex  a
tall,  thin,  gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion
looked him in the face.
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him
in  it  so  many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too
sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips  were  too
thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much
like a recently polished bay window.  The  hands  that  held  the
curtain  were  long  and  thin too: they were also cold. They lay
lightly along the folds of the curtain and  gave  the  impression
that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of
their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.

He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on
his  features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's
preying,  finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table,
where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.

A bell rang.

He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His  hands
brushed  limply  over  some  of  the one million rainbow-coloured
sequins with which his jacket was  festooned,  and  he  was  gone
through the door.

In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace,
a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway
that led up to the centre of the stage.

Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.
He  burst  on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone,
removed it from its stand with one swoop of his  long  thin  hand
and  stood  for  a  moment  bowing left and right to the audience
acknowledging their applause  and  displaying  to  them  his  bay
window.  He  waved to his particular friends in the audience even
though there weren't any there, and waited for  the  applause  to
die down.

He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not  merely
from  ear  to  ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere
confines of his face.

"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much.
Thank you so much."

He eyed them with a twinkling eye.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it  has
now  been  in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an
hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe!"

With a gesture he deftly conjured another  round  of  spontaneous
applause. With another gesture he cut it.

"I  am  your  host  for  tonight,"  he  said,  "my  name  is  Max
Quordlepleen  ..."  (Everybody  knew  this,  his  act  was famous
throughout the known  Galaxy,  but  he  said  it  for  the  fresh
applause  it  generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming
smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from  the  very
very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big
Bang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we  had  a  very  exciting
evening  ladies  and  gentlemen  -  and  I will be with you right
through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"

Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights  dimmed
down   further.   On   every  table  candles  ignited  themselves
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all  the  diners  and
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million
intimate shadows. A tremor of  excitement  thrilled  through  the
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.

Max's voice was hushed as he continued.

"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the  candles  are  lit,
the  band  plays  softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us
fades into transparency, revealing a dark  and  sullen  sky  hung
heavy  with  the  ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see
we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"

Even the soft tootling of the band faded away  as  stunned  shock
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before.

A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,

- a hideous light,

- a boiling, pestilential light,

- a light that would have disfigured hell.

The Universe was coming to an end.

For a few  interminable  seconds  the  Restaurant  span  silently
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again.

"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the  end  of
the tunnel," he said, "this is it."

The band struck up again.

"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back  with
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very
capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his  cataclysmic  Combo.  Big
hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!"

The baleful turmoil of the skies continued.

Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a  moment  or  so
normal  conversation  resumed. Max began his round of the tables,
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.

A large dairy animal  approached  Zaphod  Beeblebrox's  table,  a
large  fat  meaty  quadruped of the bovine type with large watery
eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating
smile on its lips.

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I
am  the  main  Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my
body?" It  harrumphed  and  gurgled  a  bit,  wriggled  its  hind
quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at
them.

Its gaze was met by looks of startled  bewilderment  from  Arthur
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger
from Zaphod Beeblebrox.

"Something off  the  shoulder  perhaps?"  suggested  the  animal,
"Braised in a white wine sauce?"

"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.

"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the  animal  contentedly,
"nobody else's is mine to offer."

Zaphod leapt to his feet and started  prodding  and  feeling  the
animal's shoulder appreciatively.

"Or the rump is very  good,"  murmured  the  animal.  "I've  been
exercising  it  and  eating  plenty of grain, so there's a lot of
good meat there." It gave  a  mellow  grunt,  gurgled  again  and
started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.

"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added.

"You mean this animal actually wants us  to  eat  it?"  whispered
Trillian to Ford.

"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes,  "I  don't  mean
anything."

"That's  absolutely  horrible,"  exclaimed  Arthur,   "the   most
revolting thing I've ever heard."

"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring  his
attention to the animal's enormous rump.

"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting
me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless."

"Better than eating an animal that doesn't  want  to  be  eaten,"
said Zaphod.

"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he  thought  about
it  for  a  moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I
don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just ... er
..."

The Universe raged about him in its death throes.

"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered.

"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must
be  very  rich  and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself
for months."

"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.
"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly
at Arthur.

"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I  shouldn't  have
green salad?"

"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables  that  are  very
clear  on  that  point. Which is why it was eventually decided to
cut through the whole tangled problem and breed  an  animal  that
actually  wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly
and distinctly. And here I am."

It managed a very slight bow.

"Glass of water please," said Arthur.

"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't  want  to  make  a
meal  of  the  issues.  Four  rare  steaks  please, and hurry. We
haven't eaten in five hundred and  seventy-six  thousand  million
years."

The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle.

"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,"  it  said,
"I'll just nip off and shoot myself."

He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.

"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."

It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen.

A matter of minutes later  the  waiter  arrived  with  four  huge
steaming  steaks.  Zaphod  and  Ford  wolfed  straight  into them
without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and
started into hers.

Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill.

"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin  on  the  face
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"

And the band played on.

All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and  chatted.
The  air  was  filled  with  talk  of this and that, and with the
mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and  insidious
wines.  For  an  infinite  number of miles in every direction the
universal  cataclysm  was  gathering  to  a  stupefying   climax.
Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish.

"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is  everyone  having
one last wonderful time?"

"Yes," called out the sort of people  who  call  out  "yes"  when
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.

"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful.  And  as
the  photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing
to tear apart the last of the red hot suns,  I  know  you're  all
going  to  settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find
all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."

He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye.

"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,"  he  said,  "there's  nothing
penultimate about this one."

He paused again. Tonight his timing was  immaculate.  Time  after
time  he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word
night had any meaning here at the extremity of  time.  All  there
was  was  the  endless  repetition  of  the  final moment, as the
Restaurant  rocked  slowly  forward  over  the  brink  of  time's
furthest edge - and back again. This "night" was good though, the
audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand.  His  voice
dropped. They had to strain to hear him.

"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final  chilling
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial `it'."

He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a  fly  would
not have dared cleat its throat.

"After this,"  he  said,  "there  is  nothing.  Void.  Emptiness.
Oblivion. Absolute nothing ..."

His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?"

"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and  a  fine
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!"

The band gave him a musical sting. He wished  they  wouldn't,  he
didn't  need  it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the
audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with
relief. He followed on.

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about
having  a  hangover  in  the morning - because there won't be any
more mornings!"

He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up  at  the
sky,  going  through  the  same dead routine every night, but his
glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it  to  do
its job, as one professional trusts another.

"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at  the  risk  of
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties."

He pulled a card from his pocket.

"Do we have ..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we
have  a  party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?"

A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear.
He peered around trying to find them.

"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer.

He got it, as he always did.

"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids  lads  -  and  no  cheating,
remember this is a very solemn moment."

He lapped up the laughter.

"And do we also have, do we have ... a  party  of  minor  deities
from the Halls of Asgard?"

Away to his right came  a  rumble  of  thunder.  Lightning  arced
across  the  stage.  A  small group of hairy men with helmets sat
looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to
him.

Hasbeens, he thought to himself.

"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said.

They did their trick with the lightning again. Max  gave  them  a
very thin lipped smile.

"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of  Young  Conservatives
from Sirius B, are they here?"

A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing  rolls  at
each  other  and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped
and barked unintelligibly.

"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?"

"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down  and  putting
on  his  solemn  face,  "finally  I  believe we have with us here
tonight, a party of believers, very devout  believers,  from  the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."

There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of
the  floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously,
and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked  resentfully
as the spotlight was turned on them.

"There they are," said Max, "sitting there,  patiently.  He  said
he'd  come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's
hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only  got  eight  minutes
left!"

The party of  Zarquon's  followers  sat  rigid,  refusing  to  be
buffeted  by  the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over
them.

Max restrained his audience.

"No, but seriously though folks,  seriously  though,  no  offence
meant.  No,  I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs,
so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ..."
The audience clapped respectfully.

"... wherever he's got to!"

He blew a kiss to the  stony-faced  party  and  returned  to  the
centre of the stage.

He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it.

"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many  of  you
here  tonight  -  no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous.
Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again,
which  I  think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final
end of everything, and then return home to your own eras ...  and
raise  families,  strive  for  new  and  better  societies, fight
terrible wars for what you know to be right ... it  really  gives
one  hope  for  the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he
waved at the blitzing turmoil above and  around  them,  "that  we
know it hasn't got one ..."

Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out
in his mind.

"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is  about  to  end  ...
don't we go with it?"

Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in  other
words a rather unsteady one.

"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you  come  into  this
dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal
warp thing. I think."

"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak.

"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you."

He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly  with
it.

"Look," he said  again,  "imagine  this  napkin,  right,  as  the
temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode
in the matter curve ..."

It took him a while to say this last part, and  Arthur  hated  to
interrupt him.

"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said.

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon ..." he found  a  small
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon ..." but found it
rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork ..."

"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod.

"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say ... why
don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe ..."
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?"

"Did I do that?"

"Yes."

"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean ... I mean,  look,  do
you know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick
off?"

"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd  never  embarked  on
any of this.

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You  get  this  bath.
Right. A large round bath. And it's made of ebony."

"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons."

"Doesn't matter."

"So you keep saying."

"Listen."

"Alright."

"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath.  And  it's
ebony. And it's conical."

"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of ..."

"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you
fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand,
and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's  fine.  And  when
it's full, you pull the plug out ... are you listening?"

"I'm listening."

"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls  away
you see, out of the plughole."

"I see."

"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever
bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?"

"Tell me the clever bit."

"I'll tell you the clever bit."

Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit
was.

"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening."

"Clever."

"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever  bit,  I  remember
now  that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then
thread the film in the projector ... backwards!"

"Backwards?"

"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely  the  clever  bit.  So
then,  you  just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to
spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?"

"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur.

"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax."

He reached for his wine glass.

"Where's my wine glass?" he said.

"It's on the floor."

"Ah."

Tipping back his chair to look for it,  Ford  collided  with  the
small  green  waiter  who  was  approaching  the table carrying a
portable telephone.

Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because
he was extremely drunk.

The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly
understood.

Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table.

"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter.

"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak.

"There is a phone call for you."

"Hey, what?"

"A phone call, sir."

"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?"

One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the  food
it was still shovelling in.

"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his  eating  head  and
carried on.

There were now so many people  after  him  he'd  lost  count.  He
shouldn't  have  made  such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if  there's
no one watching you have it?

"Maybe  someone  here  tipped  off  the  Galactic  Police,"  said
Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in."
"You mean they want to arrest me over the  phone?"  said  Zaphod,
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned."

"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to  pieces  so
fast people get hit by the shrapnel."

"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod.

"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously.

"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on  the
phone?"  He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him,
"I may need you."

"I am not," said the  waiter,  "personally  acquainted  with  the
metal gentlemen in question, sir ..."

"Metal?"

"Yes, sir."

"Did you say metal?"

"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally  acquainted  with  the
metal gentleman in question ..."

"OK, carry on."

"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your  return  for  a
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat
precipitately."

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange?  We  only  just
arrived here."

"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter  doggedly,  "but  before  you
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."

Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other.

"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here,  we  left
here?"

This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter.

"Precisely, sir," he said.

"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.

"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again,
"where exactly is here?"

"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B."

"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we  left  there  and
came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he  was  now  into  the
home  stretch  and  running well, "the one was constructed on the
ruins of the other."

"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but
not in space."

"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree
will you?"

Arthur bristled.

"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod.

"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod,  "your  monkey  has  got  it
right, sir."

Arthur stuttered in fury and said  nothing  apposite,  or  indeed
coherent.

"You jumped forward ... I believe five  hundred  and  seventy-six
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,"
explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling  that
he  had  finally  won  through  against  what  had  seemed  to be
insuperable odds.

"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to  send
us  to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give
or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million  years,  we
never moved. Neat."

They all agreed this was very neat.

"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?"

"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.

Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads.

"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B."

"When was this?"

"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six  thousand  million  years
ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate
Captain."

The little waiter's  eyebrows  wandered  about  his  forehead  in
confusion.

"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said.

"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."

"Indeed, sir."

"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How  you
doing, kid?"
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line.

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.

Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone.

"It's Marvin," he said.

"Hey, Marvin," he said into the  phone  again,  "we're  having  a
great  time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe
going foom. Where can we find you?"

Again the pause.

"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot."

"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?"

"`Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they  say  to  me,
`open  airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper!  Here  I  am,
brain the size of a planet and they ask me to ..."

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.

"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin,  "I  can
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would
you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket  of  water?  I've
got one ready. Wait a minute."

"Er, hey, Marvin ..." interrupted Zaphod, but it  was  too  late.
Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line.

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian.

"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash  his  head  at
us."

"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit,
"I hope that gave satisfaction ..."

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you
are?"

"I'm in the car park," said Marvin.

"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?"

"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?"

"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down."

In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw  down  the  phone
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.

"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get  on
down."
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur.

"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum."

"But what about the End of  the  Universe?  We'll  miss  the  big
moment."

"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing  but  a  gnab
gib."

"A what?"

"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."

Few of the other diners paid them any attention  as  they  weaved
their  way  through  the  Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were
riveted on the horror of the skies.

"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling  them,  "is
in  the  upper  left-hand  quadrant of the sky, where if you look
very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away
into the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?"

There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere  at
the back.

"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's  too  late  to
worry about whether you left the gas on now."




The main reception foyer was almost empty but  Ford  nevertheless
weaved his way through it.

Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred  him  into  a
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall.

"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur.

"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a  coin  into  a  slot.
Lights flashed, gases swirled.

"Hi," said Ford stepping  out  a  moment  later,  "where  are  we
going?"

"Down to the car park, come on."

"What about the personnel Time Teleports?"  said  Ford,  "Get  us
straight back to the Heart of Gold."

"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop  can  have  it.  I
don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find."

A  Sirius   Cybernetics   Corporation   Happy   Vertical   People
Transporter  took  them  down deep into the substrata beneath the
Restaurant. They were glad to see  it  had  been  vandalized  and
didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a  blast  of
cold stale air hit them.

The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long  concrete
wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for
all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every  car  park
in  the  Galaxy  throughout the entire history of car parks, this
car park smelt predominantly of impatience.

They turned a corner and found themselves  on  a  moving  catwalk
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the
dim distance.

It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship
belonging  to  one  of  the  diners  upstairs,  some smallish and
utilitarian  mass  production   models,   others   vast   shining
limoships, the playthings of the very rich.

Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or  may  not  have
been  avarice  as  he  passed  over them. In fact it's best to be
clear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was.

"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there."

They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a  small
metal  figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner
of a giant silver suncruiser.

At short intervals along the  moving  catwalk,  wide  transparent
tubes  led  down  to  floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk
into one and  floated  gently  downwards.  The  others  followed.
Thinking  back  to  this  later,  Arthur  Dent thought it was the
single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy.

"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards  to  him,  "Hey,
kid, are we pleased to see you."

Marvin turned, and in so far as it  is  possible  for  a  totally
inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did.

"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is."

"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle  the  ships.
Ford went with him.

Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin.

"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a  way  that
he  disliked  intensely,  "hanging around waiting for us all this
time."

"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand  million,  three  thousand
five  hundred  and  seventy-nine  years," said Marvin, "I counted
them."

"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, felling - quite correctly
in Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say.

"The first ten million years were the worst," said  Marvin,  "and
the  second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third
million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit
of decline."

He paused just long enough to make them feel they  ought  to  say
something, and then interrupted.

"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you  down,"
he said and paused again.

Trillian cleared her throat.

"Is that ..."

"The best conversation I had was over forty million  years  ago,"
continued Marvin.

Again the pause.

"Oh d ..."

"And that was with a coffee machine."

He waited.

"That's a ..."

"You don't like talking to me do  you?"  said  Marvin  in  a  low
desolate tone.

Trillian talked to Arthur instead.

Further down the chamber Ford  Prefect  had  found  something  of
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact.

"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some  of  these
little star trolleys ..."

Zaphod looked and liked.

The craft they were looking at  was  in  fact  pretty  small  but
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to
look at. It resembled nothing so  much  as  a  paper  dart  about
twenty  feet  long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear
end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny  charm-
drive  engine,  which  was  not capable of moving it at any great
speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink.

The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand  billion  tons  and
was  contained  within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic
field situated half-way along the length of the  ship,  and  this
heat-sink  enabled  the  craft  to  be manoeuvred to within a few
miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the  solar  flares
that burst out from its surface.

Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in
existence,  and  those who can dare and afford it are amongst the
most  lionized  men  in  the  Galaxy.  It  is  also   of   course
stupefyingly  dangerous  -  those who don't die riding invariably
die of sexual exhaustion at one of  the  Daedalus  Club's  Apres-
Flare parties.

Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on.

"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star  buggy  with  the
black sunbusters ..."

Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally  misnamed  one
in   fact,   because   the  one  thing  it  couldn't  manage  was
interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty  planet  hopper
dolled  up to something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed
on.

The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach  built
limoship  and  obviously  designed  with one aim in mind, that of
making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork  and  accessory
detail  clearly  said  "Not  only am I rich enough to afford this
ship, I am also rich enough not to take  it  seriously."  It  was
wonderfully hideous.

"Just look at  it,"  said  Zaphod,  "multi-cluster  quark  drive,
perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job."

He examined every inch.

"Yes," he said,  "look,  the  infra-pink  lizard  emblem  on  the
neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame."

"I was passed by one of these  mothers  once,  out  by  the  Axel
Nebula,"  said  Ford,  "I  was going flat out and this thing just
strolled  past  me,  star  drive  hardly   ticking   over.   Just
incredible."

Zaphod whistled appreciatively.

"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it  smashed  straight  into  the
third moon of Jaglan Beta."

"Yeah, right?"

"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a  fish,  moves  like  a
fish, steers like a cow."

Ford looked round the other side.

"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural  painted
on  this  side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This
must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this  terrible
song  you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun.
Meant to be  an  amazing  spectacle.  Expensive  in  stunt  ships
though."

Zaphod's attention  however  was  elsewhere.  His  attention  was
riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His
mouths hung open.

"That," he said, "that ... is really bad for the eyes ..."
Ford looked. He too stood astonished.

It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon,
twenty  yards  long,  very  clean, very sleek. There was just one
remarkable thing about it.

"It's so ... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make  out
its shape ... light just seems to fall into it!"

Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love.

The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost  impossible
to tell how close you were standing to it.

"Your eyes just slide off it ..." said Ford in wonder. It was  an
emotional moment. He bit his lip.

Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a  man  possessed  -  or
more  accurately  like  a  man  who  wanted  to possess. His hand
reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached  out
to stroke it again. His hand stopped again.

"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice.

Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped.

"You ... you can't ..." he said.

"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be
one mother of a mover ..."

He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of  his  heads
did - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship.

"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said.

"You mean ... er ..." Ford looked over his  shoulder.  "You  mean
stroll off with it? You think we should?"

"No."

"Nor do I."

"But we're going to, aren't we?"

"How can we not?"

They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly  pulled  himself
together.

"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the  Universe
will  have  ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down
here to find their bourge-mobiles."

"Zaphod," said Ford.

"Yeah?"

"How do we do it?"
"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called.

Slowly, laboriously, and  with  a  million  little  clanking  and
creaking  noises  that  he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned
round to answer the summons.

"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you."

Marvin trudged towards them.

"I won't enjoy it," he said.

"Yes you will,"  enthused  Zaphod,  "there's  a  whole  new  life
stretching out ahead of you."

"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin.

"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time  there's
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things."

"Sounds awful," Marvin said.

"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you ..."

"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?"

"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod  jumpily.  He
was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short.

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather  than  try  to  engage  my
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."

He walked on up to the ship, touched it,  and  a  hatchway  swung
open.

Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening.

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh,  you  didn't."  He  trudged
away again.

Arthur and Trillian clustered round.

"What's happening?" asked Arthur.

"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship."

"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod.

"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally  black
..."

In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment  after
which there wouldn't be any more moments.

All eyes were fixed on the dome, other  than  those  of  Hotblack
Desiato's  bodyguard,  which  were  looking  intently at Hotblack
Desiato,  and  those  of  Hotblack  Desiato  himself  which   the
bodyguard had closed out of respect.
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato
been  alive,  he probably would have deemed this a good moment to
lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was  not  a
man  which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate
condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.

"Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it
looked  as  if  the  muscles  on  either  side  of his mouth were
clambering over each other to get out of the way.

"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?"

Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.

"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard.

Again,  quite  naturally,  Hotblack  Desiato   did   not   reply.
Supernaturally, however, he did.

On the table in front of him a wine glass  rattled,  and  a  fork
rose  an  inch  or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on
the table again.

The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.

"It's time we get going, Mr  Desiato,"  muttered  the  bodyguard,
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You
want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a  really
big  audience  for  it.  One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred
seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have
been looking forward to it?"

The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of  way  and
dropped again.

"Ah, come on," said the  bodyguard,  "it's  going  to  have  been
great.  You  knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr
Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.

"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and  the  new
one's  a  beauty.  Be  real sorry to see it go. If we get on down
there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off  in
the limo. OK?"

The fork  tapped  once  in  agreement,  and  the  glass  of  wine
mysteriously emptied itself.

The  bodyguard  wheeled  Hotblack  Desiato's  chair  out  of  the
Restaurant.

"And now," cried Max from the centre of the  stage,  "the  moment
you've  all  been  waiting  for!" He flung his arms into the air.
Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling
synthochords.  Max  had  argued with them about this but they had
claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would  do.
His agent would have to sort it out.

"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses  into  the
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will
be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"

The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and  at  that
moment  a  still  small  trumpet  sounded  as  from  an  infinite
distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the  band.  None
of  them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke
was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet
was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done
this show, and nothing like this had  ever  happened  before.  He
drew  back  in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a
figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient  man,
bearded,  robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and
on his brow a golden crown.

"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?"

At the back of the Restaurant  the  stony-faced  party  from  the
Church  of  the  Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.

Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience.

"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for  the
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!"

Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage  and
handed his microphone to the Prophet.

Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering.  The
stars  in  his  eyes  blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone
with confusion.

"Er ..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry  I'm  a  bit  late.
I've  had  the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up
at the last moment."

He seemed nervous of the expectant  awed  hush.  He  cleared  his
throat.

"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min-"

And so the Universe ended.




One of the major selling point of that wholly  remarkable  travel
book,  the  Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the Galaxy, apart from its
relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic
written   in   large  friendly  letters  on  its  cover,  is  its
compendious and occasionally accurate  glossary.  The  statistics
relating  to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance,
are deftly set out between pages nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight
thousand  and  twenty-four  and  nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in  which  they
are  written  is  partly  explained by the fact that the editors,
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information  off
the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it
with a few footnoted in order  to  avoid  prosecution  under  the
incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws.

It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the
book  backwards  in  time  through  a  temporal  warp,  and  then
successfully sued the breakfast cereal company  for  infringement
of the same laws.

Here is a sample:

The Universe - some information to help you live in it.

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Area: Infinite.]

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this  definition  of
the word "Infinite".

Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some.  Much
bigger  than  that  in  fact, really amazingly immense, a totally
stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just  so  big
that  by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic
multiplied by colossal multiplied by  staggeringly  huge  is  the
sort of concept we're trying to get across here.

\item[Imports: None.]

It is impossible to import things into an  infinite  area,  there
being no outside to import things in from.

\item[Exports: None.]

See imports.

\item[Population: None.]

It is known that there are an infinite number of  worlds,  simply
because  there  is an infinite amount of space for them to be in.
However, not every one of them  is  inhabited.  Therefore,  there
must  be  a  finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number
divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes  no  odds,  so
the  average population of all the planets in the Universe can be
said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of  the
whole  Universe  is  also  zero, and that any people you may meet
from  time  to  time  are  merely  the  products  of  a  deranged
imagination.

\item[Monetary Units: None.]

In fact there are three  freely  convertible  currencies  in  the
Galaxy,  but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently
collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead  is  only  exchangeable  for
other  Flaninian  Pobble  Beads,  and the Triganic Pu has its own
very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis  to  one
Pu  is  simple  enough,  but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber
coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each  side,  no  one
has  ever  collected  enough  to  own  one  Pu.  Ningis  are  not
negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse  to  deal  in
fiddling  small change. From this basic premise it is very simple
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged
imagination.

\item[Art: None.]

The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one.

\item[Sex: None.]

Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely  because  of
the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that
might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied.

However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now
because   it   really   is   terribly  complicated.  For  further
information  see  Guide  Chapters  seven,  nine,   ten,   eleven,
fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four
inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide.

\end{itemize}
\end{center}



The  Restaurant  continued  existing,  but  everything  else  had
stopped.  Temporal  relastatics  held  it  and  protected it in a
nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing  -
there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist.

The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque,  the
party  was  over,  the  diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished
along with the rest of  the  Universe,  the  Time  Turbines  were
preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in
readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in
his  small  curtained  dressing room trying to raise his agent on
the tempophone.

In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent.

In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack  Desiato,  propelled
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard.

They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the  limoship
a  hatchway  swung  down from its side, engaged the wheels of the
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having
seen  his  boss  safely connected up to his death-support system,
moved up to the  small  cockpit.  Here  he  operated  the  remote
control  system  which  activated the autopilot in the black ship
lying next to the limo,  thus  causing  great  relief  to  Zaphod
Beeblebrox  who  had  been trying to start the thing for over ten
minutes.

The black ship glided smoothly forward out of  its  bay,  turned,
and  moved  down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the
end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch
chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past.

The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission,  a  passage  from
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:

The History of every major Galactic Civilization  tends  to  pass
through   three   distinct  and  recognizable  phases,  those  of
Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,
Why and Where phases.

For instance, the first phase is characterized  by  the  question
"How  can  we  eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?"
and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?"

The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End  of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated
answer to that third question.

What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually  take
a  large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the
How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity.

"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent.

"Badly," said Ford Prefect.

"Where are we going?" said Trillian.

"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.

"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent.

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.

"Basically,  what  you're  trying  to  say,"  said  Arthur  Dent,
ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of control."

The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford  and  Zaphod
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and
whined like tired children in a supermarket.

"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said  Zaphod  whose
love  affair  with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into
the flight, "Every time you try to  operate  on  of  these  weird
black  controls that are labelled in black on a black background,
a little black light lights up black to let you know you've  done
it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?"

The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the  ceiling  was
black,  the  seats  -  which  were  rudimentary  since  the  only
important trip this ship was designed  for  was  supposed  to  be
unmanned   -  were  black,  the  control  panel  was  black,  the
instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place
were  black,  the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and
when they had lifted up a corner of it they had  discovered  that
the foam underlay also was black.

"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different
wavelengths," offered Trillian.

"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur.

"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed."
In fact, though they weren't to  know  it,  the  decor  had  been
chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible
condition.

The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.

"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick."

"Time sick,"  said  Ford,  "we're  plummeting  backwards  through
time."

"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am  going  to  be
ill."

"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour  about
this place."

"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation  is  it?"
snapped Arthur.

Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over
to Arthur.

"Look, Earthman," he said angrily,  "you've  got  a  job  to  do,
right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?"

"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten  about
that."

"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of  money  in
the  right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of
yours."

"Yes but ..."

"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of  Life!  We  get  our
fingers  on  that  we  can  hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to
ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint."

Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.

"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How  should  I  know?
They  say  the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I
supposed to know what the question is? It could  be  anything.  I
mean, what's six times seven?"

Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with
excitement.

"Forty-two!" he cried.

Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead.

"Yes," he said patiently," I know that."

Zaphod's faces fell.

"I'm just saying that the question could  be  anything  at  all,"
said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know."
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when  your  planet  did
the big firework."

"We have a thing on Earth ..." began Arthur.

"Had," corrected Zaphod.

"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know."

A low voice echoed dully round the cabin.

"I know," said Marvin.

Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a  losing
battle with.

"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk."

"It's printed in the Earthman's  brainwave  patterns,"  continued
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing
that."

"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?"

"Yes," said Marvin.

Arthur stared in astonishment.

"And ...?" he said.

"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small."

"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse."

"Yes," confirmed Marvin.

"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up."

"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a  parody  of
astonishment,  "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."

"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she
was  still  capable  of  assuming  in talking to this misbegotten
creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?"

Marvin's head swivelled back to her.

"You didn't ask," he said simply.

"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round
to look at him.

At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the
engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum.

"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked  out
the controls of this boat?"
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon  we
just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast."

"Yeah, right," said Zaphod.

"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin  to
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.

"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in  this  while
ship  that  is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I
think it is, and if it's saying what I think  it's  saying,  then
we've  already  gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as
two million years before our own time."

Zaphod shrugged.

"Time is bunk," he said.

"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur.

"Me," said Zaphod.

"No. Who it really belongs to."

"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property  is  theft,  right?
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?"

"Tell the ship that," said Arthur.

Zaphod strode over to the console.

"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your  new  owner
speaking to ..."

He got no further. Several things happened at once.

The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real
space.

All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the
time trip now lit up.

A  large  vision  screen  above  the  console  winked  into  life
revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead
of them.

None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the
rear of the cabin, as were all the others.

They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of  noise  that
thuddered  out  of  the  monitor  speakers surrounding the vision
screen.




Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in  the  middle  of  the
vast  Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound
system.

That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage
technicians.  They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's
giant control ship which hung in orbit some  four  hundred  miles
above  the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound
system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker  silos
wouldn't have survived the tuning up.

If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of  the  speaker  silos
then  his  expiring thought would have been that in both size and
shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the
silos,  the  neutron  phase  speaker  stacks  towered monstrously
against the sky, obscuring the banks of  plutonium  reactors  and
seismic amps behind them.

Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers  lay
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship,
the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and  the  Megabang
drum complex.

It was going to be a noisy show.

Aboard the giant control  ship,  all  was  activity  and  bustle.
Hotblack  Desiato's  limoship,  a  mere  tadpole  beside  it, had
arrived  and  docked,  and  the  lamented  gentleman  was   being
transported  down  the  high vaulted corridors to meet the medium
who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar
keyboard.

A doctor, a  logician  and  a  marine  biologist  had  also  just
arrived,  flown  in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try
to reason with the lead singer who  had  locked  himself  in  the
bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till
it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The
bass  player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer
was nowhere on board.

Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on  a
beach  on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found  a
small stone that would be his friend.

The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the
seventeenth  time  on  this  tour  the drums would be played by a
robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would  be
right.

The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications  of  the  stage
technicians  testing  the  speaker channels, and this it was that
was being relayed to the interior of the black ship.

Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the  cabin,  and
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers.

"OK, channel nine on  power,"  said  a  voice,  "testing  channel
fifteen ..."
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.

"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice.

A third voice cut in.

"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking
good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?"

A computer voice answered.

"On line," it said.

"Take control of the black ship."

"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby."

"Testing channel twenty."

Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched  frequencies  on  the
sub-ether  receiver  before  the  next mind-pulverizing noise hit
them. He stood there quivering.

"What," said Trillian in  a  small  quiet  voice,  "does  sundive
mean?"

"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the
sun.  Sun  ...  Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you
expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?"

"How do you know ..." said Zaphod in a voice that  would  make  a
Vegan  snow  lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's
stuntship?"

"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him."

"The why ... didn't ... you ... tell us!"

"You said you wanted excitement and  adventure  and  really  wild
things."

"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily  in  the  pause  which
followed.

"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin.

On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up  a
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin.

"... fine weather  for  the  concert  here  this  afternoon.  I'm
standing  here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the
middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the  aid  of  hyperbinoptic
glasses  I  can  just  about  make out the huge audience cowering
there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker  stacks
rise  like  a  sheer  cliff  face,  and  high above me the sun is
shining away and  doesn't  know  what's  going  to  hit  it.  The
environmentalist  lobby  do know what's going to hit it, and they
claim that the  concert  will  cause  earthquakes,  tidal  waves,
hurricanes,  irreparable  damage  to  the atmosphere, and all the
usual things that environmentalists usually go on about.

"But I've just had a report that  a  representative  of  Disaster
Area  met  with  the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them
all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ..."

Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford.

"You know what I'm thinking?" he said.

"I think so," said Ford.

"Tell me what you think I'm thinking."

"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship."

"I think you're right," said Zaphod.

"I think you're right," said Ford.

"How?" said Arthur.

"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking."

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."

"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford.

It is worth repeating at this point the theories  that  Ford  had
come  up  with,  on  his  first  encounter  with human beings, to
account for their  peculiar  habit  of  continually  stating  and
restating  the  very  very  obvious,  as it 'It's a nice day," or
"You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die."

His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep  exercising
their lips, their mouths probably seized up.

After a few months of observation he had come up  with  a  second
theory,  which  was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising
their lips, their brains start working."

In fact, this  second  theory  is  more  literally  true  of  the
Belcebron people of Kakrafoon.

The  Belcebron  people  used  to  cause  great   resentment   and
insecurity  amongst  neighboring  races  by being one of the most
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet  civilizations  in
the Galaxy.

As a  punishment  for  this  behaviour,  which  was  held  to  be
offensively  self  righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal
inflicted on  them  that  most  cruel  of  all  social  diseases,
telepathy.   Consequently,   in   order   to  prevent  themselves
broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds  to
anyone  within  a  five  mile  radius, they now have to talk very
loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and
pains,  the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon
had suddenly become.
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play
host to a Disaster Area concert.

The timing of the concert was critical.

The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in  order
to  hit  the  sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the
climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of  the
solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.

The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the  time
that   Ford  Prefect  had  completed  his  search  of  the  other
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin.

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed  terrifyingly  large  on  the  vision
screen,  its  blazing  white  inferno  of  fusing hydrogen nuclei
growing moment by moment as the ship plunged  onwards,  unheeding
the  thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel.
Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions  of  rabbits  on  a
night   road  who  think  that  the  best  way  of  dealing  with
approaching headlights is to stare them out.

Zaphod span round, wild-eyed.

"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?"

"None," said Ford.

Zaphod gibbered.

"Did you count them?" he yelled.

"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the  stage  crew  on
the radio?"

"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a  whole  bunch
of people on board, and they said to say `hi' to everybody."

Ford goggled.

"Didn't you tell them who we were?"

"Oh yeah. They said it was a great  honour.  That  and  something
about a restaurant bill and my executors."

Ford pushed Arthur aside and  leaned  forward  over  the  control
console.

"Does none of this function?" he said savagely.

"All overridden."

"Smash the autopilot."

"Find it first. Nothing connects."

There was a moment's cold silence.

Arthur was stumbling round the back  of  the  cabin.  He  stopped
suddenly.

"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?"

Another moment passed.

Slowly, the others turned to face him.

"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said  Arthur,  "It's  just  I
remember  hearing  you  use the word a short while ago and I only
bring it up because ..."

"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?"

"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at  a  dark
control  box  in  the  rear  of  the  cabin, "Just under the word
`emergency', above the word `system' and beside the  sign  saying
`out of order'."

In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the  only  action  to
follow  was  that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the
small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly
at the single small black button set into it.

A  six-foot  square  panel  slid  open  beside  it  revealing   a
compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found
a new function in life as  an  electrician's  junk  store.  Half-
finished  wiring  hung  from  the  ceiling, a jumble of abandoned
components lay strewn on the floor,  and  the  programming  panel
lolled  out  of  the cavity in the wall into which it should have
been secured.

A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting  the  shipyard  where
this  ship  was  being  constructed,  had demanded to know of the
works foreman  why  the  hell  they  were  fitting  an  extremely
expensive  teleport  into  a  ship  which  only had one important
journey to make, and that unmanned.  The  foreman  had  explained
that  the  teleport  was available at a ten per cent discount and
the accountant  had  explained  that  this  was  immaterial;  the
foreman  had  explained that it was the finest, most powerful and
sophisticated teleport that money could buy  and  the  accountant
had  explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman
had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the
ship  and  the  accountant  had explained that the ship sported a
perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had  explained  that  the
accountant  could  go  and  boil  his head and the accountant had
explained to the foreman that the thing approaching  him  rapidly
from  his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had
been concluded, work  was  discontinued  on  the  teleport  which
subsequently  passed  unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns."
at five times the price.

"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he  and  Ford  attempted  to
sort through the tangle of wiring.

After a moment or so Ford told him to stand  back.  He  tossed  a
coin  into  the  teleport  and  jiggled  a  switch on the lolling
control panel. With  a  crackle  and  spit  of  light,  the  coin
vanished.
"That much of  it  works,"  said  Ford,  "however,  there  is  no
guidance  system. A matter transference teleport without guidance
programming could put you ... well, anywhere."

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.

"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go."

"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We  couldn't  all  go.
Someone would have to stay and operate it."

A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger.

"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?"

"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin.

A shortish while later,  the  concert  on  Kakrafoon  reached  an
unexpected climax.

The black ship with its single morose  occupant  had  plunged  on
schedule  into  the  nuclear  furnace  of  the sun. Massive solar
flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling
and  in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had
been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation  of
the moment.

Moments before the flare light  reached  Kakrafoon  the  pounding
desert  cracked  along  a  deep  faultline.  A  huge and hitherto
undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed
to  the  surface  to be followed seconds later by the eruption of
millions of tons of boiling lava that  flowed  hundreds  of  feet
into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and
below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side  of
the world and back again.

Those - very few - who witnessed the  event  and  survived  swear
that  the  whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose
into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself  over  and
fell  back  down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from
the flares filtered through the clouds  of  vaporized  water  and
struck the ground.

A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert  was  thick
with  flowers.  The structure of the atmosphere around the planet
was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly  in  the  summer,
the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more
often,  and  slowly  the  desert  world  of  Kakrafoon  became  a
paradise.  Even  the  telepathic  power  with which the people of
Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the  force
of the explosion.

A spokesman for Disaster Area - the  one  who  had  had  all  the
environmentalists  shot  - was later quoted as saying that it had
been "a good gig".

Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A  few
sceptical  scientists  examined  the  records  of the events more
closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a
vast  artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a
nearby region of space.




Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it.  Hangovers  he'd  had,
but  never  anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big
one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter  transference  beams,  he
decided,  were  not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the
head.

Being for the moment unwilling to  move  on  account  of  a  dull
stomping  throb  he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.
The  trouble  with  most  forms  of  transport,  he  thought,  is
basically  one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth -
when there had been an Earth, before it was  demolished  to  make
way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.
The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky  slime
from  out  of  the  ground where it had been safely hidden out of
harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke  to
fill  the  air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed
to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from
one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at
had probably become, as a result of this,  very  similar  to  the
place  you  had  left,  i.e.  covered with tar, full of smoke and
short of fish.

And what about matter transference beams? Any form  of  transport
which  involved  tearing  you  apart atom by atom, flinging those
atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back  together
again  just  when  they were getting their first taste of freedom
for years had to be bad news.

Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent  and  had
even  gone  to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one
that used regularly to be chanted  by  huge  crowds  outside  the
Sirius   Cybernetics  Corporation  Teleport  Systems  factory  on
Happi-Werld III:

Aldebaran's great, OK,

Algol's pretty neat,

Betelgeuse's pretty girls,

Will knock you off your feet.

They'll do anything you like,

Real fast and then real slow,

But if you have to take me apart to get me there,

Then I don't want to go.

Singing,
Take me apart, take me apart,

What a way to roam,

And if you have to take me apart to get me there,

I'd rather stay at home.

Sirius is paved with gold

So I've heard it said

By nuts who then go on to say

"See Tau before you're dead."

I'll gladly take the high road

Or even take the low,

But if you have to take me apart to get me there,

Then I, for one, won't go.

Singing,

Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head,

And if you try to take me apart to get me there,

I'll stay right here in bed.


I teleported home one night,

With Ron and Sid and Meg,

Ron stole Meggie's heart away,

And I got Sidney's leg.

Arthur felt the waves of pain  slowly  receding,  though  he  was
still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood
up.

"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect.

Arthur span round  and  wobbled  uncertainly.  Ford  Prefect  was
approaching looking red eyed and pasty.

"Where are we?" gasped Arthur.

Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor
which  stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel
wall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which
they  use  in  schools,  hospitals and mental asylums to keep the
inmates subdued - curved over the tops of their  heads  where  it
met  the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered
in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor  was  of  dark  green
ribbed rubber.

Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the
outer  wall.  It was several layers deep, yet through it he could
see pinpoints of distant stars.

"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.

Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.

"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?"

Ford shrugged.

"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could  be  anywhere.
An  unprogrammed  teleport  can  throw  you  light  years  in any
direction. Judging by  the  way  I  feel  I  should  think  we've
travelled a very long way indeed."

"How do you feel?"

"Bad."

"Do you think they're ..."

"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and  no
way we can do anything about it. Do what I do."

"What?"

"Don't think about it."

Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw  the
wisdom  of  it,  tucked  it  up  and  put it away. He took a deep
breath.

"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly.

"Where?"

"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!"

Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from
an  indeterminate  distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder.

"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved  -  in  opposite
directions.

"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from."

"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way."

"They're not, they're ..."

They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently.
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite
directions again.
Fear gripped them.

>From both directions the noise was getting louder.

A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to
the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark,
immensely long and,  as  they  passed  down  it,  gave  them  the
impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors
gave off it to the left  and  right,  each  very  dark  and  each
subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.

They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor
they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.

They pressed themselves back against the cold wall  and  listened
furiously.  The  cold,  the  dark and the drumming of disembodied
feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered,  partly  with  the
cold,  but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother
used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle
high  to  an  Arcturan  Megagrasshopper:  stories  of dead ships,
haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the  obscurer  regions
of  deep  space  infested  with demons or the ghosts of forgotten
crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered
such  ships;  stories  of  ...  -  then Ford remembered the brown
hessian wall weave in  the  first  corridor  and  pulled  himself
together.  However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their
death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay  any  money  you
liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the
arm.

"Back the way we came,"  he  said  firmly  and  they  started  to
retrace their steps.

A moment later they leap like startled lizards down  the  nearest
corridor  junction  as  the  owners of the drumming feet suddenly
hove into view directly in front of them.

Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as  about  two
dozen  overweight  men and women pounded past them in track suits
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart  surgeon
gibber.

Ford Prefect stared after them.

"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed  away  up
and down the network of corridors.

"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent.

"Joggers," said Ford prefect with a shrug.

The corridor they were concealed in was not like the  others.  It
was  very  short,  and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined
it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.

The first thing that hit their eyes was what  appeared  to  be  a
coffin.

And the next four thousand nine hundred  and  ninety-nine  things
that hit their eyes were also coffins.




The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At  the  far
end,  about  three  hundred  yards away an archway let through to
what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.

Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on  to  the
floor of the vault.

"Wild," he said.

"What's so great about  dead  people?"  asked  Arthur,  nervously
stepping down after him.

"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?"

On  closer  inspection  the  coffins  seemed  to  be  more   like
sarcophagi.  They  stood about waist high and were constructed of
what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly  what
it  was  -  something  that only appeared to be white marble. The
tops were semi-translucent,  and  through  them  could  dimly  be
perceived  the  features  of  their  late and presumably lamented
occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the  troubles
of  whatever  world  it  was  they came from far behind them, but
beyond that little else could be discerned.

Rolling slowly round the  floor  between  the  sarcophagi  was  a
heavy,  oily  white  gas  which  Arthur at first thought might be
there to give the place a little atmosphere until  he  discovered
that  it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely
cold to the touch.

Ford suddenly crouched down beside  one  of  them.  He  pulled  a
corner  of  his  towel  out  of  his  satchel  and started to rub
furiously at something.

"Look, there's a plaque on this one,"  he  explained  to  Arthur,
"It's frosted over."

He rubbed the frost clear and examined the  engraved  characters.
To  Arthur  they  looked like the footprints of a spider that had
had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on  a  night
out,  but  Ford  instantly  recognized  an early form of Galactic
Eezeereed.

"It says `Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven,  Telephone
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number."

"A  telephone  sanitizer?"  said  Arthur,   "a   dead   telephone
sanitizer?"

"Best kind."

"But what's he doing here?"

Ford peered through the top at the figure within.
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins  of
his  which  always  made  people think he'd been overdoing things
recently and should try to get some rest.

He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk  towel
work and he announced:

"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!"

The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place
of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained
a second-hand car salesman, third class.

An inspection hatch let into the  floor  suddenly  caught  Ford's
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at
the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.

A thought occurred to Arthur.

"If these are just coffins," he  said,  "Why  are  they  kept  so
cold?"

"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway,"  said  Ford  tugging  the
hatchway  open.  The  gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is
anyone going to all the  trouble  and  expense  of  carting  five
thousand dead bodies through space?"

"Ten thousand," said Arthur,  pointing  at  the  archway  through
which the next chamber was dimly visible.

Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up
again.

"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there."

"Fifteen million," said a voice.

"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot."

"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your  hands  up.
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits."

"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting  his  hands  up
and not making any other move.

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?"

Standing silhouetted  in  the  doorway  through  which  they  had
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His
displeasure was communicated  partly  by  the  barking  hectoring
quality  of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he
waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer  of  the
gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make
it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear  that  this  gun
has  a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone
standing at the wrong end that things are going badly  for  them.
If  that  means  sticking  all  sort  of  spikes  and  prongs and
blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a  gun  for
hanging  over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it
is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."

Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.

The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round  them.
As  he  came  into  the  light  they could see his black and gold
uniform on which the buttons were so highly  polished  that  they
shone  with  an  intensity  that  would  have made an approaching
motorist flash his lights in annoyance.

He gestured at the door.

"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of  fire  power
don't  need  to  supply  verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out,
closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun  and  the
buttons.

Turning into  the  corridor  they  were  jostled  by  twenty-four
oncoming  joggers,  now  showered  and changed, who swept on past
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.

"Move!" screamed their captor.

Arthur moved.

Ford shrugged and moved.

In the vault the joggers went  to  twenty-four  empty  sarcophagi
along  the  side  wall,  opened  them,  climbed in, and fell into
twenty-four dreamless sleeps.




"Er, captain ..."

"Yes, Number One?"

"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two."

"Oh, dear."

High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain  stared  out  into
the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he
reclined beneath a wide domed bubble  he  could  see  before  and
above  them  the  vast  panorama of stars through which they were
moving - a panorama that had thinned  out  noticably  during  the
course  of  the  voyage.  Turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far  denser  mass
of  stars  behind  them which seemed to form almost a solid band.
This was the view through the Galactic  centre  from  which  they
were  travelling,  and indeed had been travelling for years, at a
speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he  knew
it  was  terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of
something or other, or was it three times the speed of  something
else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance
behind the ship, looking for something. He  did  this  every  few
minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't
let it worry him  though.  The  scientist  chaps  had  been  very
insistent  that  everything  was  going  to  be perfectly alright
providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their  bit
in an orderly fashion.

He wasn't panicking. As far as he was  concerned  everything  was
going  splendidly.  He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he  was  feeling  mildly
irritated  about something. Now what was all that about? A slight
cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first  officer  was
still standing nearby.

Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very  brightest,  had  the  odd
spot  of  difficulty  doing  up  his  shoe  laces, but jolly good
officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a
chap  when  he  was  bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,
however long it took him.  Not  like  that  ghastly  Number  Two,
strutting  about  all  over  the  place,  polishing  his buttons,
issuing reports  every  hour:  "Ship's  still  moving,  Captain."
"Still   on   course,   Captain."   "Oxygen  levels  still  being
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the  Captain's  vote.
Ah  yes,  that  was  the  thing  that had been irritating him. He
peered down at Number One.

"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or  other  about  having
found some prisoners ..."

The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty  unlikely  to  him,
but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way.

"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said,  "He's
always wanted some."

Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  trudged  onwards  up  the  ship's
apparently  endless  corridors.  Number  Two  marched behind them
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves  or
trying  any  funny  stuff.  They seemed to have passed at least a
mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached
a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.

They entered.

To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most  remarkable
thing  about  the  ship's  bridge was not the fifty foot diameter
hemispherical dome  which  covered  it,  and  through  which  the
dazzling  display of stars shone down on them: to people who have
eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such  wonders
are  commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur
this  was  exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to
look like, and  to  Ford  it  looked  thoroughly  antiquated:  it
confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken
them back at least a million, if not two  million,  years  before
their own time.

No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.

The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough  hewn  blue  water
crystal  and  was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside
the Maximegalon Museum  of  Diseased  Imaginings.  An  intestinal
jumble  of  plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than
decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave;  the  taps  and
shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.

As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was  terribly
wrong,  and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this
that Number Two approached it.

"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth -  a  difficult
trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it.

A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above
the rim of the monstrous bath.

"Ah, hello, Number  Two,"  said  the  Captain,  waving  a  cheery
sponge, "having a nice day?"

Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.

"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven,
sir!" he yapped.

Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion.

"Er ... hello," they said.

The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really  found  some
prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a
chap doing what he's best at.

"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me  not  getting  up,
having  a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in
the fridge Number one."

"Certainly sir."

It is a curious fact, and one to which no  one  knows  quite  how
much  importance  to attach, that something like 85% of all known
worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced,  have
invented  a  drink  called  jynnan  tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or
jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or  more  variations  on
the  same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same,
and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary
water   server  at  slightly  above  room  temperature,  and  the
Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which  kills  cows  at  a  hundred
paces;  and  in  fact  the one common factor between all of them,
beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they  were
all  invented  and named before the worlds concerned made contact
with any other worlds.

What can be made of this fact? It exists in total  isolation.  As
far  as  any  theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is
right  off  the  graph,  and  yet  it  persists.  Old  structural
linguists  get  very  angry when young structural linguists go on
about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about  it
and  stay  up late at night convinced that they are very close to
something  of  profound  importance,  and  end  up  becoming  old
structural  linguists  before their time, getting very angry with
the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided  and
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend
too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.

Number Two stood before  the  Captain's  bathtub  trembling  with
frustration.

"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed.

The Captain peered at him in bemusement.

"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked.

"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why  they  came
here!"

"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in
for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?"

"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!"

The Captain looked at them doubtfully.

"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to
drink."

A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly
on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.

"All right, you scum," he growled, "you  vermin  ..."  He  jabbed
Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun.

"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently.

"What do you want to drink!!!" Number Two screamed.

"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What
about you Arthur?"

Arthur blinked.

"What? Oh, er, yes," he said.

"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two.

"Oh, with please," said Ford.

"Lemon??!!"

"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have  any  of  those  little
biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?"

"I'm asking  the  questions!!!!"  howled  Number  Two,  his  body
quaking with apoplectic fury.

"Er, Number Two ..." said the Captain softly.

"Sir?!"
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to  have  a
relaxing bath."

Number Two's eyes narrowed and  became  what  are  known  in  the
Shouting  and  Killing  People  trade  as  cold  slits,  the idea
presumably being to give your opponent the  impression  that  you
have  lost  your  glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.
Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.

He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin  hard
line.  Again,  tricky  to know why this is understood as fighting
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal,  you
were  suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,
you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard
line  rather  than,  as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering
fangs.

"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the  Captain,  "that
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final
shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to  a
corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.

The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave  Ford  Prefect  a  lame
smile.

"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said.

Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked  no  reaction.  Arthur
lowered his.

Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to  the  bath
pedestal. He patted it.

"Nice," he lied.

He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he
grinned. It was safe.

"Er ..." he said to the Captain.

"Yes?" said the Captain.

"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is
in fact?"

A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.

It was the first officer.

"Your drinks," he said.

"Ah, thank you," said Ford.  He  and  Arthur  took  their  jynnan
tonnyx.  Arthur  sipped  his,  and  was  surprised to discover it
tasted very like a whisky and soda.

"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip,
"the bodies. In the hold."

"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise.
Ford paused and thought  to  himself.  Never  take  anything  for
granted,  he  thought.  Could it be that the Captain doesn't know
he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship?

The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be
playing with a rubber duck.

Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the  mirror,
but  only  for  an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.
The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray
and smiling benignly.

"Bodies?" said the Captain again.

Ford licked his lips.

"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and  account
executives, you know, down in the hold."

The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back  his  head  and
laughed.

"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen.
They're going to be revived."

Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.

Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.

"You mean you've got a hold  full  of  frozen  hairdressers?"  he
said.

"Oh yes," said the  Captain,  "Millions  of  them.  Hairdressers,
tired  TV  producers,  insurance  salesmen,  personnel  officers,
security  guards,   public   relations   executives,   management
consultants,  you  name  them.  We're  going  to colonize another
planet."

Ford wobbled very slightly.

"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain.

"What, with that lot?" said Arthur.

"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain,  "we're  just
one  of  the  ships  in the Ark Fleet. We're the `B' Ark you see.
Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?"

Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.

"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do  help  yourselves  to  more
drinks of course."

Ford tossed down his  drink,  took  the  bottle  from  the  first
officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top.

"What," he said, "is a `B' Ark?"
"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy  water  around
joyfully with the duck.

"Yes," said Ford, "but ..."

"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our  planet,
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed."

"Doomed?"

"Oh yes. So what everyone  thought  was,  let's  pack  the  whole
population  into  some  giant  spaceships  and  go  and settle on
another planet."

Having told this much of  his  story,  he  settled  back  with  a
satisfied grunt.

"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur.

"What did you say dear fellow?"

"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on."

"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided  to  build  three
ships,  you  see, three Arks in Space, and ... I'm not boring you
am I?"

"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating."

"You know it's  delightful,"  reflected  the  Captain,  "to  have
someone else to talk to for a change."

Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then
settled  back  on  the  mirror,  like  a  pair  of  flies briefly
distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat.

"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued  the  Captain,
"is  that  you  end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets
terribly boring because half the time you know what you're  going
to say next."

"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise.

The Captain thought for a moment.

"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?"  He  fished
around and found it.

"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into  the  first
ship,  the  `A'  ship,  would  go  all the brilliant leaders, the
scientists, the great artists, you know, all the  achievers;  and
into  the third, or `C' ship, would go all the people who did the
actual work, who made things and did things, and  then  into  the
`B'  ship - that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you
see."

He smiled happily at them.
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed  a  little
bathing tune.

The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him  by  one
of  his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was
currently asleep in  hold  thirty-six  some  nine  hundred  yards
behind  them)  covered  what would otherwise have been an awkward
moment of silence.  Ford  and  Arthur  shuffled  their  feet  and
furiously avoided each other's eyes.

"Er ..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly  was  it  that
was wrong with your planet then?"

"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently  it
was  going  to  crash  into the sun or something. Or maybe it was
that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the  kind.
Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was."

"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?"

Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard  light  that
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in.

"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My  commanding  officer
told  me  that  the entire planet was in imminent danger of being
eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!"

"Oh really ..." said Ford Prefect.

"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit  of  hell  with  scything
teeth  ten  thousand  miles  long, breath that would boil oceans,
claws that could tear continents from  their  roots,  a  thousand
eyes  that  burned  like  the sun, slavering jaws a million miles
across, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ..."

"And they made sure they  sent  you  lot  off  first  did  they?"
inquired Arthur.

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said,  very  nicely  I
thought,  that it was very important for morale to feel that they
would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a  good
haircut and where the phones were clean."

"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be  very  important.
And the other ships, er ... they followed on after you did they?"

For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in  his
bath  and  gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards
the bright galactic centre. He squinted  into  the  inconceivable
distance.

"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he  said  and  allowed
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough
we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years  ago
... but they must be behind us somewhere."

He peered off into the distance again.
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.

"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the  goat
..."

"Ah yes ..." said the Captain with a  slight  hesitancy  creeping
into  his  voice,  "the  goat ..." His eyes passed over the solid
shapes of the instruments and computers that  lined  the  bridge.
They  winked  away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars,
but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and  second
officers,  but  they  seemed  lost  in  their  own thoughts for a
moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who  raised  his  eyebrows  at
him.

"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean
does it strike you as odd Number Two?"

"Errrrrrrrrrrr ..." said Number Two.

"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got  a  lot  of  things
you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you
could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ..."

"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said  the  Captain,
"because   our  trajectory  thingy  was  preset  before  we  left
Golgafrincham, I think partly because  I'm  not  very  good  with
figures ..."

"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly
losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you meant to be
reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?"

"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain,  "any  second
now.  It's  probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.
Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"

"So we're actually going to land in a minute?"

"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land  as  such,  no
... er ..."

"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply.

"Well," said the Captain,  picking  his  way  through  the  words
carefully,  "I  think as far as I can remember we were programmed
to crash on it."

"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur.

"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of  the  plan  I
think.  There  was  a  terribly  good reason for it which I can't
quite remember at the moment. It was something  to  with  ...  er
..."

Ford exploded.

"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.
"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason."




The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say  about  the
planet  of  Golgafrincham:  It  is  a  planet with an ancient and
mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and  occasionally  green
with  the  blood  of those who sought in times gone by to conquer
her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry
air  heady  with  the  scent of the perfumed springs that trickle
over its hot and dusty rocks  and  nourish  the  dark  and  musty
lichens   beneath;  a  land  of  fevered  brows  and  intoxicated
imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the  lichens;  a
land  also  of  cool  and  shaded thoughts amongst those who have
learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath;  a
land  also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and
of the spirit. This was its history.

And  in  all  this  ancient  and  mysterious  history,  the  most
mysterious  figures  of all were without doubt those of the Great
Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets  used  to  live  in
remote  mountain  passes  where  they would lie in wait for small
bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at
them.

And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away
and  get  on  with writing some poems instead of pestering people
with all this rock-throwing business, they would  suddenly  stop,
and  then  break  into  one  of the seven hundred and ninety-four
great  Song  Cycles  of  Vassilian.  These  songs  were  all   of
extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all
fell into exactly the same pattern.

The first part of each song would tell how there once went  forth
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four
horses. The princes, who are of course  brave,  noble  and  wise,
travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic
philosophies, take tea  with  weird  gods  and  rescue  beautiful
monsters  from ravening princesses before finally announcing that
they have achieved enlightenment and that  their  wanderings  are
therefore accomplished.

The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of
all  their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to
walk back.

All this lay in the planet's remote  past.  It  was,  however,  a
descendant  of  one  of  these  eccentric  poets who invented the
spurious tales of impending doom  which  enabled  the  people  of
Golgafrincham  to  rid  themselves  of an entire useless third of
their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home  and
lived  full,  rich  and  happy lives until they were all suddenly
wiped  out  by  a  virulent  disease  contracted  from  a   dirty
telephone.




That night the ship crash-landed on to an  utterly  insignificant
little  green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow
sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end  of  the
Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.

In  the  hours  preceding  the  crash  Ford  Prefect  had  fought
furiously  but  in  vain  to unlock the controls of the ship from
their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to
him  that  the  ship  had  been  programmed to convey its payload
safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to  cripple  itself
beyond repair in the process.

Its  screaming,  blazing  descent  through  the  atmosphere   had
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and
its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp  had  left  its
crew  only  a  few  hours  of darkness during which to revive and
offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began  to
settle  almost  at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the
stagnant slime. Once or twice during the  night  it  was  starkly
silhouetted  against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of
its descent - flashed across the sky.

In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene  roaring  gurgle
and sank for ever into the stinking depths.

When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin  watery  light
over  a  vast  area  heaving  with  wailing  hairdressers, public
relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing
their way desperately to dry land.

A less strong minded sun would probably have gone  straight  back
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and
after a while the influence of its warming  rays  began  to  have
some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.

Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp  in
the  night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship,
but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands  and
as  the  day  wore  on  they  crawled  out  over  the surrounding
countryside, each looking for a few square feet of  solid  ground
on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.

Two figures moved further afield.

>From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent  watched  the
horror of which they could not feel a part.

"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur.

Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.

"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said.

"Why can't people just  learn  to  live  together  in  peace  and
harmony?" said Arthur.

Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh.
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin,  "No,  doesn't  work.
Never mind."

Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing  nothing  to
indicate  the  contrary,  realized  that  it  would  be perfectly
reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.

"What do you think will happen to them  all?"  he  said  after  a
while.

"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said  Ford,  "Even
survival. Strange but true."

A curious look came  into  his  eyes  as  they  passed  over  the
landscape  and  then  settles  again on the scene of misery below
them.

"I think they'll manage for a while," he said.

Arthur looked up sharply.

"Why do you say that?" he said.

Ford shrugged.

"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to  any  further
questions.

"Look," he said suddenly.

Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst  the  sprawling
masses  a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more
accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his
shoulder.  As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them  in  a  drunken
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a
heap.

Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.

"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement."

"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after  a  moment,
"but I'm off."

He sat a while in silence.

After a while this seemed to require comment.

"Er, when you say you're off, what do  you  mean  exactly?"  said
Arthur.

"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence."

Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was  twiddling  with
knobs  on  a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently  and
not  pursued  the  matter. In his mind the Universe still divided
into two parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having
been  demolished  to  make  way for a new hyperspace bypass meant
that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended
to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact
with his home. Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matics  belonged  firmly  in  the
"everything else" category.

"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing.

Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at  the
primitive  world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth
sausage.

"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that  there  are
no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted
tip? Are you listening to me?"

"What?" said Arthur.

"We're in trouble," said Ford.

"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him.

"Until we pick up anything on  this  machine,"  said  Ford,  "our
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field  -  in  which
case  we  just  travel  round  and  round  till  we  find a clear
reception area. Coming?"

He picked up his gear and strode off.

Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the  movie  camera  had
struggled  back  up  to  his feet just in time to film one of his
colleagues collapsing.

Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.




"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to  Zaphod  and
Trillian  as  they  rematerialized  on the bridge of the starship
Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor.

Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.

"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to  find
a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.

"I  have  programmed  the   computer   with   the   Improbability
Coordinates  pertinent  to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will
arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why  don't  you  relax  and
prepare yourself for the meeting?"

Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a  small
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took
a long pull at it.

"And when this is all done," said Zaphod  savagely,  "it's  done,
alright?  I'm  free  to go and do what the hell I like and lie on
beaches and stuff?"

"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop.

"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?"

"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man
who rules the Universe."

"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle  from  Zaphod  and  helping
herself, "a social climber."




The major problem - one of the  major  problems,  for  there  are
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who  manages  to  get
people to let them do it to them.

To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the  summary:  anyone  who  is  capable  of  getting
themselves  made  President should on no account be allowed to do
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary:  people  are  a
problem.

And so this is the situation we find: a  succession  of  Galactic
Presidents  who  so  much  enjoy  the fun and palaver of being in
power that they very rarely notice that they're not.

And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who?

Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed
to?




On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle  of  nowhere  in
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it
is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which  only  six
men in this galaxy have a key - it was raining.

It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped
a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.

The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated  iron  roof  of  the
small  shack  that  stood  in the middle of this patch of scrubby
land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that  led  from  the
shack  down  to  the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of
interesting shells which had been placed there.

The noise of the rain on the roof  of  the  shack  was  deafening
within,  but  went  largely  unnoticed  by  its  occupant,  whose
attention was otherwise engaged.
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured  hair  that
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.

In his shack was an old  beaten-up  armchair,  an  old  scratched
table,  an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small
but warm.

There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten  cat,  and  this
was  currently  the  focus  of  the  man's attention. He bent his
shambling form over it.

"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo ...  pussy
want his fish? Nice piece of fish ... pussy want it?"

The  cat  seemed  undecided  on  the  matter.  It  pawed   rather
condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor.

"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,"
said the man. Doubt crept into his voice.

"I imagine this is what will happen," he said,  "but  how  can  I
tell?"

He proffered the fish again.

"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it  is
better if I don't get involved." He sighed.

"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so  who
am I to judge?"

He left the fish on the floor for the cat,  and  retired  to  his
seat.

"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last,  as  the  cat
exhausted  the  entertainment  possibilities of the speck of dust
and pounced on to the fish.

"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the  man,  "because
in my mind you will waste away if you don't."

He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the  stub  of  a
pencil.  He  held one in one hand and the other in the other, and
experimented with the different ways of bringing  them  together.
He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper,
then next to the paper. He tried wrapping  the  paper  round  the
pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the
paper and then he tried rubbing  the  sharp  end  of  the  pencil
against  the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the
discovery, as he was every day. He picked  up  another  piece  of
paper  from  the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it
briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.

He tried sitting on one of his hands and  was  intrigued  by  the
feel of the bones of his hip.

"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so  I'm  told.  Or  so  I
imagine  I'm  told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men
come in their six black ships, do they come  in  your  mind  too?
What do you see pussy?"

He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with  getting  the
fish  down  as  rapidly  as  possible  than  it  was  with  these
speculations.

"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What  do
their  voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing
songs to you." He reflected on this, and  saw  the  flaw  in  the
supposition.

"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he  said,  "and  I  just
think they're asking me questions."

He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just  to  see
what it was like.

"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do.  There's  mud  on
the  floor,  cigarettes  and whisky on the table, fish on a plate
for you and a memory  of  them  in  my  mind.  Hardly  conclusive
evidence  I  know,  but  then all evidence is circumstantial. And
look what else they've left me."

He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.

"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator."

He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to
sleep  and  the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put
the calculator aside.

"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me  questions,"  he
said,  "To  come  all that way and leave all these things for the
privilege  of  singing  songs  to  you  would  be  very   strange
behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell."

>From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with  a  spill
from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back.

"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said  at  last.
"A  big  white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six
black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who  say  they
come  from  so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small
black ones can look like one big  white  one  at  certain  times.
Perhaps  I  would  like  a  glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more
likely."

He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by  the
mattress.  He  poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat
again.

"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said.

A hundred yards away, pelted by  the  torrential  rain,  lay  the
Heart of Gold.

Its hatchway opened, and three  figures  emerged,  huddling  into
themselves to keep the rain off their faces.

"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.

"Yes," said Zarniwoop.

"That shack?"

"Yes."

"Weird," said Zaphod.

"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have
come  to  the  wrong  place.  You  can't rule the Universe from a
shack."

They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet  through,
at the door. They knocked. They shivered.

The door opened.

"Hello?" said the man.

"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe ..."

"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod.

The man smiled at him.

"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?"

Zaphod looked at him in astonishment.

"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?"

"That's how it looks to me," said the  man,  "but  how  you  feel
about  it  might  be  an altogether different matter. If you feel
warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in."

They went in.

They  looked  around  the  tiny  shack,  Zarniwoop  with   slight
distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight.

"Hey, er ..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?"

The man looked at them doubtfully.

"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name."

He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on  the  edge  of
the  chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod
lay on the mattress.

"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat.

"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions."
"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my  cat  if  you
like."

"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod.

"You'd better ask him," said the man.

"Does he talk?" said Zaphod.

"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I  am  very
unreliable."

Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket.

"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?"

"How can I tell?" said the man.

Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper.

"How long have you been doing this?"

"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?"

Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't  exactly  what
he had been expecting.

"Yes," he said.

"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past  isn't  a  fiction
designed  to  account  for  the  discrepancy between my immediate
physical sensations and my state of mind?"

Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his  sodden
clothes.

"So you answer all questions like this?" he said.

The man answered quickly.

"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say
things. More I cannot say."

Zaphod laughed happily.

"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle  of  Janx
spirit.  He  leaped  up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the
Universe, who took it with pleasure.

"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is."

"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do  they?
In ships ..."

"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian.

"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for  them?
About  people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars,
about everything going on out there in the Universe?"
"Out there?" said the man, "out where?"

"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door.

"How can you tell there's  anything  out  there,"  said  the  man
politely, "the door's closed."

The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside  the  shack  it  was
warm.

"But  you  know  there's  a  whole  Universe  out  there!"  cried
Zarniwoop.  "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they
don't exist!"

The ruler of  the  Universe  thought  for  a  long  while  whilst
Zarniwoop quivered with anger.

"You're very sure of your facts," he said at  last,  "I  couldn't
trust  the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is
one - for granted."

Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent.

"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay."

"But don't you believe in anything?"

The man shrugged and picked up his cat.

"I don't understand what you mean," he said.

"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours
affects  the  lives  and fates of millions of people? This is all
monstrously wrong!"

"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of.  And
neither,  I  suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear.
It is folly to say you know what is happening  to  other  people.
Only  they  know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of
their own eyes and ears."

Trillian said:

"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment."

She left and walked into the rain.

"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop.

"I have no opinion. How can I say?"

"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped
out.

Outside, he said to her:

"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"
"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.

Inside, Zarniwoop continued.

"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?"

The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he
heard  the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to
cover it.

"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am  not  involved  with
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man."

"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you  say  `The  Lord'.  You  believe  in
something!"

"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and  stroking  it,
"I call him The Lord. I am kind to him."

"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How  do  you
know  he  exists?  How  do  you  know he knows you to be kind, or
enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?"

"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It  merely
pleases  me  to  behave  in a certain way to what appears to be a
cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired."

Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about.

"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly.

"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe,  settling  back
into his chair and refilling his whisky glass.

"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!"

"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ..."

"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into  the  rain.  There
was  no  ship.  The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no
sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the  rain.
He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.

The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in  his  chair.  After  a
while  he  played  with  the  pencil  and the paper again and was
delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the  one  on
the  other.  Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know
whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for  a
week to see how it would react.




The stars came out that night, dazzling in their  brilliance  and
clarity.  Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any
means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was  cool
and  balmy,  the  air  pure,  the  Sub-Etha  Sens.O.Matic totally
silent.
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical  calm  which
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter
of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to  soothe  their
jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than
he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder  if  this
was  the  most  beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had
passed through rolling green hills and  valleys,  richly  covered
with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees,
the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept  them  cool,  and
Ford  Prefect  had  checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and
less  frequent  intervals,  and  had  exhibited  less  and   less
annoyance  at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he
liked it here.

Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and  comfortably
in  the  open  and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall
feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some  small  rolls
into  his  satchel  at  Milliways  and they breakfasted off those
before moving on.

So far they had wandered purely at random, but  now  they  struck
out  firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore
this world they should have some clear idea  of  where  they  had
come from and where they were going.

Shortly before noon they had  their  first  indication  that  the
world  they  had  landed  on  was  not an uninhabited one: a half
glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them.  It  vanished  at
the  moment  they  both saw it, but the image they were both left
with was of a humanoid creature, curious  to  see  them  but  not
alarmed.  Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and
ten minutes after that another.

A minute later they stumbled into a  wide  clearing  and  stopped
short.

Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of  about
two  dozen  men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small  children
and  behind  the  group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings
made of mud and branches.

Ford and Arthur held their breath.

The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet  high,  they
all  stooped  forward  slightly,  had  longish  arms  and  lowish
foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared  intently
at the strangers.

Seeing that they carried no weapons  and  made  no  move  towards
them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.

For a while the two groups simply stared at each  other,  neither
side   making  any  move.  The  natives  seemed  puzzled  by  the
intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were
quite clearly not issuing any invitations.

For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.

"Hello," he said.

The women drew their children slightly closer to them.

The men made hardly any discernible  move  and  yet  their  whole
disposition  made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it
was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.

One of the men, who had been standing  slightly  forward  of  the
rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader,
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.

"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly.

This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving
an  instantaneous  and  unconscious  translation of everything he
heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased  to
be  aware  of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by
the fact that it didn't seem to  be  working.  Vague  shadows  of
meaning  had  flickered  at  the  back of his mind, but there was
nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly  as
it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the
barest rudiments  of  language,  and  that  the  Babel  Fish  was
therefore  powerless  to  help.  He  glanced  at  Ford,  who  was
infinitely more experienced in these matters.

"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking
us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village."

A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm
this.

"Ruurgggghhhh  urrgggh;  urgh  urgh  (uh  ruh)   rruurruuh   ug,"
continued the man-creature.

"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that
we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if
we would walk round his village rather than through it  it  would
make them all very happy."

"So what do we do?"

"I think we make them happy," said Ford.

Slowly and watchfully they walked  round  the  perimeter  of  the
clearing.  This  seemed to go down very well with the natives who
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.

Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood.  A  few
hundred  yards  past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small
pile  of  fruit  lying  in  their  path  -  berries  that  looked
remarkably  like  raspberries  and blackberries, and pulpy, green
skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.

So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries  they  had
seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them.
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and  berries
on  strange  planets  either  make  you  live  or  make  you die.
Therefore the point at which to start toying with  them  is  when
you're  going  to  die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The
secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food."

They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.

"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er ..."

"Yes?" said Arthur.

"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get
to eat it," said Ford.

The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the  pulp  skins  of  the  things
which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries
and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur  had  ever
seen, even in ice cream commercials.

"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said.

"Maybe that's what they want us to do."

"Alright, look at it this way ..."

"Sounds good so far."

"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's  bad,  either
they  want  to  feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we
don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If  we  don't
eat, we lose out either way."

"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one."

Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like
pears.

"I always thought that about the  Garden  of  Eden  story,"  said
Ford.

"Eh?"

"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?"

"Yes of course I do."

"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise
surprise, they eat it  and  he  leaps  out  from  behind  a  bush
shouting  `Gotcha'.  It wouldn't have made any difference if they
hadn't eaten it."

"Why not?"

"Because if you're dealing with somebody  who  has  the  sort  of
mentality  which  likes  leaving hats on the pavement with bricks
under them you know perfectly well they won't  give  up.  They'll
get you in the end."

"What are you talking about?"

"Never mind, eat the fruit."

"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden."

"Eat the fruit."

"Sounds quite like it too."

Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.

"It's a pear," he said.

A few moments later, when they had eaten the  lot,  Ford  Prefect
turned round and called out.

"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind."

They went on their way.

For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they  kept  on
finding  the  occasional  gift  of fruit lying in their path, and
though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of  a  native  man-
creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.
They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear
that they were grateful simply to be left alone.

The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was
where the sea started.

Having no pressing calls on their time  they  built  a  raft  and
crossed  the  sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles
wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing,  landing  in  a
country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.

Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a  while  at  least
they  were  able  to  cope  with  the problems of aimlessness and
isolation by deciding  to  ignore  them.  When  the  craving  for
company  became  too  great they would know where to find it, but
for the moment they were happy to feel  that  the  Golgafrinchans
were hundreds of miles behind them.

Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was
so faint and from such enormous distance that  it  depressed  him
more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.

On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling  they
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time
it was harder going,  the  climate  was  getting  colder.  Arthur
suspected  a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing
difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense  of  purpose
that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.

Their journey northwards  brought  them  into  steep  mountainous
terrain  of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow
covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite  into
their bones.

They wrapped themselves in  animal  skins  and  furs  which  Ford
Prefect  acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of
ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in  the  Hills  of
Hunian.

The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all  on  the  make,
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a
form of devotional discipline are,  frankly,  sensational  -  and
extraordinary  numbers  of  monks leave the Order just after they
have finished their devotional training and just before they take
their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest
of their lives.

Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a
while and smiling.

After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from  out
of  the  trees  and  watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to
smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he  would  seem
to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to
embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would  descend  on
the  surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from
this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would  approach,  step  by
step,  until  it  was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect
would reach out to it and break its neck.

"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to  know  how
to generate the right smell."




A few days after landing in this  mountainous  land  they  hit  a
coastline  which swept diagonally before them from the south-west
to the north-east,  a  coastline  of  monumental  grandeur:  deep
majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.

For two further days they scrambled and climbed  over  the  rocks
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty.

"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly.

It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting  on  a
high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the
craggy promontories.

"Arthur!" yelled Ford again.

Arthur looked to  where  Ford's  voice  had  come  from,  carried
faintly in the wind.

Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur  found  him  there
crouching  by  the  solid  wall  of  blue  ice. He was tense with
excitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's.
"Look," he said, "look!"

Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.

"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it."

"No," said Ford, "you've looked  at  it,  you  haven't  seen  it.
Look!"

Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.

Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.

"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again."

Arthur moved back and looked again.

"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed  to  be  looking
for?"

And suddenly he saw it.

"You see it?"

He saw it.

His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it  hadn't  got
anything  to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to
contend with the problem of what  his  eyes  told  it  they  were
looking  at,  but  in  doing so relinquished control of the mouth
which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up  the  jaw,
his  brain  lost  control  of  his  left hand which then wandered
around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain  tried
to  catch  the  left  hand  without  letting  go of the mouth and
simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in  the  ice,
which  is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully
to the ground.

The thing that had been causing  all  this  neural  upset  was  a
network  of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the
surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the
solid  shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three
feet  high;  and  for  those,  like  Arthur,  who  couldn't  read
Magrathean  there  was  above  the  letters the outline of a face
hanging in the ice.

It was an old face, thin  and  distinguished,  careworn  but  not
unkind.

It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.




A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and  howled  through  the
trees  upsetting  the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust.
The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it
rasped, it generally offended.
The  Captain,  however,  regarded  the  lone  bagpiper  with   an
indulgent  eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once
he had got over  the  loss  of  his  gorgeous  bath  during  that
unpleasantness  in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to
find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped
out  of  a  large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing,
and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants  sloshed  water
over  him.  Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they
hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would
come,  and  in  the  meantime  search  parties  were scouring the
countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably  one  in  a
nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To
those who said that they had  a  feeling  soap  wasn't  found  in
mines,  the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was
because no one had looked hard enough, and this  possibility  had
been reluctantly acknowledged.

No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about  it  was
that  when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en
suite,  and  when  in  the  fullness  of  time   the   cry   came
reverberating  across  the  hills  that  the  soap  mine had been
located and was producing five hundred cakes a day  it  would  be
more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look
forward to.

Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the  bagpipes,
increasing  the  Captain's  already  considerable pleasure at the
thought that any moment now they might stop. That  was  something
he looked forward to as well.

What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so  many  things:
the  red  and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;
the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a
couple  of  hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing
art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six
shiny  telephones  lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath.
The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all  the  time
(or  indeed  at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all).

Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of  people
slowly  assembling  in  the  clearing  around  him  to  watch the
afternoon committee meeting.

The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on  the  beak.  The
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.

Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree  on  the
edge  of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from
foreign climes. After his six  month  journey  he  was  lean  and
healthy,  his  eyes  gleamed,  he  wore a reindeer-skin coat; his
beard was as thick and his face  as  bronzed  as  a  country-rock
singer's.

He and Arthur Dent  had  been  watching  the  Golgafrinchans  for
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit.

The clearing was now full. Hundreds  of  men  and  women  lounged
around,  chatting,  eating  fruit,  playing  cards  and generally
having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track  suits  were  now
all  dirty  and  even  torn, but they all had immaculately styled
hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their
track  suits  full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be
some form of insulation against the coming  winter.  Ford's  eyes
narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could
they?

In the middle of these  speculations  the  Captain's  voice  rose
above the hubbub.

"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to  some  sort
of  order  if  that's  at  all  possible.  Is  that  alright with
everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a  minute.  When  you're  all
ready."

The talking gradually died away and  the  clearing  fell  silent,
except  for  the  bagpiper  who  seemed  to  be  in some wild and
uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few  of  those  in  his
immediate  vicinity  threw  some  leaves to him. If there was any
reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.

A small group of people had clustered round the Captain  and  one
of  them  was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing
up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance  as
if  to  signify  to  the  crowd  that  he would be with them in a
minute.

The crowd of course were riveted and all  turned  their  eyes  on
him.

A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be  the  right
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.

Ford dropped down out of the tree.

"Hi there," he said.

The crowd swivelled round.

"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches  on
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?"

"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what  he'd
prepared.  He  decided  he'd  better  be a little stronger on the
subject.

"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead  I  bring  you
news ..."

"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had
a hot bath in weeks."

Ford refused to be headed off.

"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might  interest
you."
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.

Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.

"Now, come on," he said.

"Well I'm sorry," said  the  man  huffily,  "but  speaking  as  a
management  consultant  of many years' standing, I must insist on
the importance of observing the committee structure."

Ford looked round the crowd.

"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet."

"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant.

"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock."

The management consultant decided that  testiness  was  what  the
situation now called for.

"Well, call it a chair," he said testily.

"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford.

"You  obviously  have  no  conception,"   said   the   management
consultant,  not  abandoning  testiness  in  favour  of  good old
fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods."

"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford.

A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.

"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion."

"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser.

"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant.

"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing."  He  plonked
himself  down  on  the  ground  to see how long he could keep his
temper.

The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.

"I would like to call to order," he said  pleasantly,  "the  five
hundred  and  seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee
of Fintlewoodlewix ..."

Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.

"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred  and  seventy-three
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!"

"If you would care," said the girl with the strident  voice,  "to
examine the agenda sheet ..."

"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily.
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford.

"... you ... will ... see ..." continued the girl  firmly,  "that
we  are  having  a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development
Sub-Committee today."

"Oh ... ah -" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which  is
recognized  the  whole  Galaxy  over  as  meaning  "Er, will next
Tuesday do?"

"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done?  What
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?"

"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me  was
a couple of sticks ..."

"So what have you done with them?"

Nervously, the hairdresser fished  in  his  track  suit  top  and
handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford.

Ford held them up for all to see.

"Curling tongs," he said.

The crowd applauded.

"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day."

The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded.

"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said  the
girl,  "When  you've  been  in marketing as long as I have you'll
know that before any new product can be developed it  has  to  be
properly  researched. We've got to find out what people want from
fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."

The crowd were tense. They  were  expecting  something  wonderful
from Ford.

"Stick it up your nose," he said.

"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,"  insisted
the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?"

"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd.

"Yes!" shouted some.

"No!" shouted others happily.

They didn't know, they just thought it was great.

"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy?
It sounds a terribly interesting project."

"Ah," said the marketing  girl,  "Well,  we're  having  a  little
difficulty there."
"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford,  "Difficulty?  What  do  you  mean,
difficulty?  It's  the  single  simplest  machine  in  the entire
Universe!"

The marketing girl soured him with a look.

"Alright, Mr Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you  tell  us
what colour it should have."

The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought.  Ford
shrugged his shoulders and sat down again.

"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?"

As if in answer to his question there was  a  sudden  clamour  of
noise  from  the  entrance  to  the  clearing. The crowd couldn't
believe the  amount  of  entertainment  they  were  getting  this
afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the
remnants of their  Golgafrincham  3rd  Regiment  dress  uniforms.
About  half  of  them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now
carried spears which they struck together as they  marched.  They
looked  bronzed,  healthy,  and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.
They clattered to a halt and banged to  attention.  One  of  them
fell over and never moved again.

"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for  he  was  their  leader  -
"Permission to report sir!"

"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot
springs?" said the Captain despondently.

"No sir!"

"Thought you wouldn't."

Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the
bath.

"We have discovered another continent!"

"When was this?"

"It lies across the sea ..." said Number Two, narrowing his  eyes
significantly, "to the east!"

"Ah."

Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above  his
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd.

"We have declared war on it!"

Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the  clearing
- this was beyond all expectation.

"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!"

He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while  he  got
it,  or  at  least  the  best silence he could hope for under the
circumstances: the  circumstances  were  that  the  bagpiper  was
spontaneously composing a national anthem.

"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford.

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant."

Ford considered opening this  idea  up  for  debate  but  quickly
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.

"War?" he said.

"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.

"On the next continent?"

"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!"

"But there's no one even living there yet!"

Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.

Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect  his  eyes
were  like  a  couple  of mosquitos that hover purposefully three
inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes,
fly swats or rolled newspapers.
